## About the Project and What I Learned
This project is a prototype for a company called Swiss Wood Solutions that sells various types of objects created using sustainable methods. A friend who works their asked if I could build a model for him to show the company. 

My learning objective in this project is to create an app that has a real-world business use. I have gained valuable experience communicating with a vendor of sorts in order to achieve a better understanding of what are looking for in a product as well as getting feedback for what they would like changed.  

## Improvements and Possible Future Features
- Store user information in a database
- Create a login feature for returning customers
- Responsive design
